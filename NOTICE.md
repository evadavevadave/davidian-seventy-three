GPL-3.0-or-later covers everything in this repository unless listed below: the DSP and GUI source, the LV2, VST3 and Audio Unit wrappers, the tests, the build files, the LV2 metadata and AU property list (`bundle/`), the GUI artwork and stroke font (both drawn in code), `docs/gui.png` (rendered by the plugin's own GUI code) and the documentation.

AI was used to make this software. See [AI_USAGE.md](AI_USAGE.md).

## Third-party material

### LV2 interface declarations (ISC)

`src/lv2_abi.h` and the UI ABI block at the top of `src/ui/ui_lv2.c` declare the LV2 C interface with the same names and layout as the LV2 headers, so the build needs no LV2 SDK. No other LV2 code is included.

ISC is compatible with the GPL, so the combined work is distributed under GPL-3.0-or-later.

### VST3 C API header (BSD 3-clause)

`src/vst3/vst3_c_api.h` is Steinberg's machine-generated C version of the VST3 interfaces, from <https://github.com/steinbergmedia/vst3_c_api>, included unchanged with its licence in `src/vst3/LICENSE.txt`. It declares the interfaces; it contains no SDK code. `src/vst3/vst3.c` implements the plugin against it.

### Used by the build but not included

| Component | Licence | How it is used |
|---|---|---|
| Microsoft C runtime | Microsoft Visual Studio licence | Linked statically into the Windows DLLs by `build.bat` (`/MT`). It is a system library under GPL-3.0 section 1. |
| Xlib (libX11) | MIT/X11 | Linked dynamically by the Linux GUI. |
| lilv, from the Ardour 9 install | ISC | Loaded at run time by `test/lilv_check.c` only. Not shipped in the bundle. |
| Win32 user32/gdi32, macOS Cocoa, AudioToolbox, AudioUnit and CoreAudio frameworks, C maths library | System libraries | Linked dynamically. |
| Steinberg VST3 SDK validator | MIT | Built and run by the Windows CI only, to check the VST3. Not shipped. |
| Apple `auval` | Part of macOS | Run by the macOS CI only, to check the Audio Unit. |
| GCC/Clang runtime (`-static-libgcc` on MinGW) | GPL with the GCC Runtime Library Exception | Only when built with MinGW. |
| lilv-utils (`lv2info`), Xvfb | ISC, MIT/X11 | Used by the Linux CI checks only. Not shipped. |

## Circuit and reference sources

- **Circuit:** the model follows the topology, switch positions, filter frequencies and transformer loading networks of a reference schematic supplied by Davidian. Component values and circuit topology are facts used to write an original simulation. The schematic image is not included in the bundle or in version control (`.gitignore` excludes it).
- **Estimated values:** the schematic does not show the insides of the amplifier and equaliser cards. Their gains, clipping levels, transformer core limits and EQ curve shapes are estimates, tuned so the model meets the published performance figures for this class of channel (frequency response, distortion at +20 dBu, maximum output). `test/test_dsp.c` checks those figures. Only the numbers are used.
- **Names:** "Seventy-Three" is Davidian's model name for this plugin. No console maker's brand or model names are used in the plugin's name, URI, files or GUI, and Davidian is not affiliated with any console maker.
- **GUI design:** original, in the Davidian house style. The controls follow the usual top-to-bottom order of a channel strip, but the panel does not copy any console's logo, lettering, knob colours or panel artwork.
